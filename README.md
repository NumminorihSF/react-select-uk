react-select-uk
============

A `dropdown` control element (from [uikit](http://getuikit.com)) for [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/index.html) with fallback to native 
`<select>` element for server-rendering, mobile-devices.


## Installation

The easiest way to use this dropdown is to install it from NPM and include it in your own React 
build process (using [Browserify](http://browserify.org), etc).

```sh
npm install react-select-uk --save
```

## Usage

react-select-uk use custom uk-dropdown.

On server rendering it will return html `select` element for capability with disabled js.

Also by default, if user use touch-device, it will use html `select` just because it is more comfortable then drop-down.
   
```javascript

var UKSelect = require('react-select-uk');

<div>
  <UKSelect value={1} options={[
    { name: 'one', value: 1 },
    { name: 'two', value: 2 },
    { name: 'three', value: 3 }
  ]}/>
</div>
